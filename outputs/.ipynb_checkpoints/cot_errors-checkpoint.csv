HINT1 had been shown to have different expression in postmortem brains between schizophrenia patients and unaffected controls. 3. HINT1 was associated with the dysregulation of postsynaptic dopamine transmission, thus suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases. 4. In this work, we studied 8 SNPs around the HINT1 gene region using the Irish study of high density schizophrenia families (ISHDSF, 1350 subjects and 273 pedigrees) and the Irish case control study of schizophrenia (ICCSS, 655 affected subjects and 626 controls). 5. We found nominally significant differences in allele frequencies in several SNPs for both ISHDSF and ICCSS samples in sex-stratified analyses. 6. However, the sex effect differed between the two samples. 7. In expression studies, no significant difference in expression was observed between patients and controls. 8. However, significant interactions amongst sex, diagnosis and rs3864283 genotypes were observed. 9.
