Insulin and somatostatin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and isolated pancreatic islets is measured by radioimmunoassay. The paracrine effects of somatostatin within pancreatic islets are blocked by cyclosomatostatin, a somatostatin receptor antagonist. Receptor subtype NmUR1, but not NmUR2, is expressed in the endocrine pancreas, predominantly in the periphery. NmU reduces insulin secretion from in situ perfused rat pancreas and stimulates somatostatin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets.

We examined the relationship between the presence of VLEM and significant histologic changes in esophageal mucosal biopsies. Between January 1, 1992, and August 31, 1994, the senior author (JFF) performed 255 esophageal biopsies. The procedure reports, available endoscopic photographs, and histology reports were reviewed to establish the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the esophageal mucosa. Intraepithelial cells were counted in a blind review of 42 randomly selected biopsies. The esophageal mucosa had a normal appearance on 160 endoscopic studies (Group 1) and VLEM were the only mucosal abnormalities in 41 endoscopies (Group 2). Histology was normal in 92 of 160 biopsies (57.5%) from Group 1, and 1 of 41 biopsies (2.4%) from Group 2. Most patients in Group 2 had eosinophilic esophagitis (34 of 41, 83%), which was of moderate to severe intensity (31 of 34, 91.2%). Based on these findings, we conclude that VLEM are a true endoscopic manifestation of esophagitis in children.",not in context,0,0.0,0,1,0,178,5532

The groups are patients who received different concentrations and total amounts of gadolinium chelate injected at different rates. The patients were randomly assigned to one of four groups: original or diluted to 50% gadolinium chelate, single or half-dose, injected at 1 or 0.5 mL/second. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the abdominal aorta and its major branches were calculated, and two blinded readers rated the respective image qualities. The results showed that the SNR and CNR of the abdominal aorta and the common iliac artery in the 0.5 mL/second groups were statistically significantly lower than those in the 1 mL/second groups.

44,cot,yes,"Reasoning:In this study, malnutrition was found to be associated with arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients. However, the exact mechanisms of this association are not fully understood. One proposed mechanism is that malnutrition leads to increased levels of inflammatory cytokines, which can promote vascular calcification. Another mechanism is that malnutrition can lead to increased levels of homocysteine, which is a known risk factor for vascular calcification. Additionally, malnutrition may also cause changes in bone metabolism, which could contribute to vascular calcification. Therefore, it is possible that malnutrition is an inducer of arterial calcification in hemodialysis patients, but further research is needed to confirm this association.Final Answer: Yes",yes,1,1.0,0,0,0,106,2548

Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) has been recommended as adjuvant therapy for NF, improving patient mortality and outcome. A retrospective evaluation of treatment outcome in 37 patients treated for NF between 1984 and 1993 was carried out. The mortality rate, morbidity criteria, and risk factors for grave prognosis were compared between a group of 25 patients who received HBO as part of their treatment protocol and a group of the remaining 12 patients treated by surgical excision and antibiotics alone. The two groups were found to be similar with regard to age, gender, the incidence of individual risk factors for ominous prognosis, and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score for disease's severity on presentation.

89,cot,yes,"Final Answer: No. Reasoning: The study investigates the influence of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on perisinusoidal cell function. It is done by measuring serum levels of beta-N-acetyl hexosaminidase (beta-NAH) and hyaluronic acid (HA), which are released from perisinusoidal cells, and comparing them in 31 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and in 6 female patients who underwent other laparoscopic procedures. The study finds no significant increase in serum levels of beta-NAH after laparoscopic cholecystectomy, while HA levels increased significantly. Therefore, the study shows that laparoscopic cholecystectomy does not influence perisinusoidal cell function.",no,0,0.0,0,0,0,89,2826

The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. The study compares the pain control between two groups: Group 1 received 1.0% ropivacaine hydrochloride soaked swabs packed in their tonsillar fossae, and Group 2 received saline-soaked swabs. The pain control is measured by using McGill's face scale. The study finds that the two groups are not significantly different in the first hour after the surgery (p > 0.05). But for the other hours and days, the two groups are statistically significant (p < 0.001). The study also finds that the other post-operative parameters such as nausea, fever, vomiting, odor, bleeding, otalgia and trismus are not statistically different between the two groups. The study finds no complications associated with ropivacaine hydrochloride.

95,cot,no,"Reasoning: In this study, the authors aimed to examine the presence of base deficit (BD) in patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to assess if it correlates with the outcomes in these patients. The authors conducted a retrospective observational study, and included 108 patients who were over the age of 16 and had isolated TBI. Of these 108 patients, 81.5% had BD, while 18.5% had base excess. The authors then examined the association between BD and mortality, and found that there was no statistically significant difference in means of BD between survivors and non-survivors. The area under the receiver operator curve (ROC) for BD as a predictor of mortality was also statistically non-significant. The authors then examined the association between BD and unfavorable outcome, and found that BD on admission had a statistically significant negative correlation with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on presentation and Revised Trauma Score (RTS). However, the authors stated that the number of patients with unfavorable outcomes was small, so they could not perform multivariate logistic regression to adjust for other confounding variables. Therefore, the authors concluded that BD is not a good predictor of mortality or unfavorable outcome in patients with isolated severe TBI.",no,1,1.0,0,0,0,201,4572
