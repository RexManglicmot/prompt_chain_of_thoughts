Important factors affecting clinicians' attitudes toward and use of the Web-based system included clinician-specific factors (eg, need for autonomy and perceptions of lack of time) and environmental factors (eg, hospital policy on protocol use, endorsement of the system, and availability of appropriate infrastructure, such as sufficient computers).

The study used a Markov state-transition model to evaluate the cost and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for unilateral fixation of hip fracture alone (including internal fixation or arthroplasty) compared with unilateral fixation and contralateral prophylactic hip fixation performed at the time of hip fracture or unilateral fixation and bilateral hip pad protection. The study found that prophylactic fixation was not cost-effective for a 79-year-old woman. The study also found that prophylactic fixation was cost-effective for women 71 to 75 years old who had 30% greater relative risk for a contralateral fracture and women younger than age 70 years. The study found that cost-effectiveness was greater when the additional costs of prophylaxis were less than $6000.

988,cot,yes,"| Reasoning: The study examines whether the federal cash transfer program to poor elderly, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, affects old-age disability. The study uses the 1990 and 2000 censuses, employing state and year fixed-effect models, to test whether within-state changes in maximum SSI benefits over time lead to changes in disability among people aged sixty-five and older. Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates. Among all single elderly individuals, 30 percent have mobility limitations, and an increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit caused the rate of mobility limitations to fall by 0.46 percentage points. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. First, analyses limited to those most likely to receive SSI produced larger effects, but analyses limited to those least likely to receive SSI produced no measurable effect. Second, varying the disability measure did not meaningfully alter the findings. Third, excluding the institutionalized, immigrants, individuals living in states with exceptionally large benefit changes, and individuals living in states with no SSI supplements did not change the substantive conclusions. Fourth, Medicaid did not confound the effects. Finally, these results were robust for married individuals.
