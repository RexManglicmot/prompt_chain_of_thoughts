The study reports the D/R ratio (Hill-Sachs lesion depth/humeral head radius) on an AP X-ray in internal rotation and the D1/D2 ratio (diameter of the involved glenoid articular surfaces (D1)/the healthy one (D2)) on a comparative Bernageau glenoid profile view. The study reports the correlation between humeral and glenoid defects by observer 1 (r = 0.23, p = 0.22) and observer 2 (r = 0.05, p = 0.78). The study reports the agreement of the observers for the D/R ratio (ICC = 0.89 ± 0.04, p < 0.00001) and good agreement for the D1/D2 ratio (ICC = 0.54 ± 0.14, p = 0.006). The study reports the sample size calculation. The study reports the prevalence of combined humeral and glenoid defects (79–84%). The study reports the prevalence of Hill-Sachs lesion (23 ± 12%).

Higher benefits are linked to lower disability rates. Among all single elderly individuals, 30 percent have mobility limitations, and an increase of $100 per month in the maximum SSI benefit caused the rate of mobility limitations to fall by 0.46 percentage points. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. First, analyses limited to those most likely to receive SSI produced larger effects, but analyses limited to those least likely to receive SSI produced no measurable effect. Second, varying the disability measure did not meaningfully alter the findings.

1008,cot,not in context,| Final Answer: yes | Reasoning: the passage states aspirin reduced recurrent MI; effect described as reduction not neutrality; result observed across subgroups implying robustness; comparator suggests improvement over standard care; no evidence of harm offsetting benefit is highlighted; language is affirmative rather than uncertain; therefore the correct label is yes,yes,0,0.0,0,0,1,51,1096

1010,cot,not in context,"| Reasoning: The passage describes a randomized trial of aspirin for prevention of recurrent myocardial infarction. The results are described as reduction in recurrent myocardial infarction, and the reduction was consistent across subgroups. The comparator was usual care, and there was no evidence of harm. The language used is affirmative, suggesting the conclusion is certain. Therefore, the correct label is yes.",no,0,0.0,0,0,1,61,1396
