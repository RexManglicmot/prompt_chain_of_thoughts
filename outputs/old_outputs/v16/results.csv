The insertion was successful in 145 out of 150 attempts. 3. Eight participants corrected the position of the device after recognizing that it was inserted inverted or twisted. 4. Within the first 2 minutes, 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the Laryngeal Mask Supreme® and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). 5.
