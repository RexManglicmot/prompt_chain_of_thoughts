58,cot,yes,"Reasoning:The authors of this study used a dataset from Chile between the years 2000 and 2012 to determine the effectiveness of the Chilean traffic law reform on reducing traffic fatalities and severe injuries. The authors used regression analysis to study the impact of the enactment of the traffic law reform on traffic fatalities and severe injuries. They also studied the impact of police traffic enforcement on these outcomes.The authors found that the enactment of the traffic law reform in interaction with number of traffic tickets per police officer was significantly associated with a decrease in traffic fatalities and severe injuries. They also found that police traffic enforcement reduced traffic fatalities by 59% and severe injuries by 37%.The authors used data from a single country, Chile, and the intervention being studied was specific to Chile. Therefore, it is difficult to generalize these findings to other countries. However, the authors did use robust regression analysis and a unique dataset with assembled information from public institutions. Therefore, their findings may be applicable to other countries.",not in context,0,0.0,0,1,0,172,3327
