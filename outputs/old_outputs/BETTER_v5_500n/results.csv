330,cot,yes,"Final Answer: no | Reasoning: the inverse equity hypothesis states that new health interventions are initially primarily accessed by the rich, but that inequalities narrow with diffusion to the poor; the study examined the relationship between overall coverage and economic inequalities in coverage of cancer screening in four middle-income countries; coverage for breast cancer screening was 10.5% in South Africa, 19.3% in China, 33.8% in Russia and 43% in Mexico, and coverage for cervical cancer screening was 24% in South Africa, 27.2% in China, 63.7% in Mexico and 81.5% in Russia; economic inequalities in screening participation were substantially lower or non-existent in countries with higher aggregate coverage, for both breast cancer screening (RII: 14.57 in South Africa, 4.90 in China, 2.01 in Mexico, 1.04 in Russia) and cervical cancer screening (RII: 3.60 in China, 2.47 in South Africa, 1.39 in Mexico, 1.12 in Russia); therefore the correct label is no",no,0,0.0,0,0,0,150,4077

427,cot,yes,Final Answer: no | Reasoning: the passage states no reduction was observed; outcomes were the same as placebo; authors concluded no benefit; this rules out yes or maybe; therefore the correct label is no,no,0,0.0,0,0,0,34,719
179,direct,yes,yes,yes,1,1.0,0,0,0,1,49
179,cot,yes,Final Answer: yes | Reasoning: the study reports a reduction in anxiety in the intervention group; the reduction in anxiety was maintained in the follow-up period; the reduction in anxiety was independent of the trait anxiety on admission; the reduction in anxiety was associated with a reduction in postoperative complications; the study design was randomized controlled; the study population was clearly defined; the study was conducted in a single hospital; the study was published in a peer-reviewed journal; therefore the correct label is yes,yes,1,1.0,0,0,0,84,1645

445,cot,yes,"no | Reasoning: the study reports that 71.2% of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages occurred in the night-time. This is a majority of the cases. The study also reports that 28.8% of post-tonsillectomy late haemorrhages occurred in the daytime. This is a minority of the cases. The study also reports that the difference in the frequencies of night-time and daytime haemorrhages is statistically significant. This means that the night-time haemorrhages are not equally distributed with the daytime haemorrhages. Therefore, the correct label is no.",no,0,0.0,0,0,0,82,2220
