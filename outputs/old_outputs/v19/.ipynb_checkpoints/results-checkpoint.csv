This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS. Prospective observational study. University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital. Laboratory work was conducted at the Institute of Nephrology.

This study included four examiners who took measurements of pin protrusion beyond the distal cortices using first ultrasonography and then by direct measurement post dissection. The results demonstrated that ultrasonography underestimates Schanz pin protrusion length measurements from both ultrasonography and direct measurement post dissection (p<0.01).
