What is the sample size?There were 248 bones that were fractured and examined with ultrasound, X-ray, and CT.How many bones were fractured?There were 162 of 248 bones that were fractured.How many fractures were identified using ultrasound?There were 130 fractures identified using ultrasound.How many fractures were identified using X-ray?There were 148 fractures identified using X-ray.What is the result of comparing ultrasound and X-ray in the detection of fracture type?There were some advantages of X-ray over ultrasound in the detection of fracture type (80 correct results using X-ray, 66 correct results using ultrasound).What is the result of comparing ultrasound and X-ray in the identification of dislocation?There were some advantages of ultrasound over X-ray for dislocation identification (41 correct results using X-ray, 51 correct results using ultrasound).After adjustment for multiple testing, what are the results of comparing ultrasound and X-ray in the detection of fracture type and in the identification of dislocation?Both findings were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing.What is the conclusion?Is ultrasound equal to X-ray in pediatric fracture diagnosis?",not in context,0,0.0,0,1,0,221,5666
