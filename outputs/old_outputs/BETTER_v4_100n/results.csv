The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression. One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%. In multivariate analysis adjusting for age, race, PSA screening, and family history of PCa, digoxin use was associated with a reduction in the odds ratio of PCa (OR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.30-1.10). Among those with ≥3 PSA tests over the preceding 5 years (546 cases, 380 controls), digoxin use was associated with a stronger reduction of PCa risk (OR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.20-0.98).",yes,1,1.0,0,0,0,123,3705
