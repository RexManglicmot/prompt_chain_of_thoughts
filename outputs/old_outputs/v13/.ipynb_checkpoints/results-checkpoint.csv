The SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive subscale was related to symptoms of depression (r = .81, P<.005), anxiety (r = .66, P<.005), and subjective complaints of memory problems (r = .75, P<.005). Multivariate analyses indicated that reported symptoms of depression contributed 66% of the variance in predicting SCL 90-R obsessive-compulsive scores, whereas symptoms of anxiety contributed an additional 6% (P<.0001).",yes,1,1.0,0,0,0,69,2459

19,cot,no,"Final Answer: Yes.Reasoning: Most pediatric surgeons perform oophorectomy in girls presenting with ovarian torsion in which the ovary appears necrotic. However, the adult gynecology literature suggests that many ovaries can be treated by detorsion alone. All children with ovarian torsion on the gynecology and general surgery services between 1988 and 2002 were reviewed. There were 36 torsions in 34 children. Seventeen underwent detorsion with or without ovarian cystectomy, and 19 had oophorectomy (mean age 10 years in both groups). Torsion was suspected preoperatively in 94% of the detorsion cases and in 47% of the oophorectomy patients. Median time from presentation to surgery was significantly lower in the detorsion than the oophorectomy group (median 14 v 27 hours; P =.04). Postoperative complications and length of stay were similar between the 2 groups. Despite the ovary being judged intraoperatively as moderately to severely ischemic in 53% of the detorsion cases, follow-up sonogram or ovarian biopsy available in 14 of the 17 cases showed normal ovary with follicular development in each case.Not in context.",yes,0,0.0,0,0,0,171,4862

From February 2001 to January 2003, 219 patients (75 with primary and 144 with recurrent cervical cancer) were eligible for analysis. Sixteen had hyperglycaemic DM, 12 had euglycaemic DM and 191 were in the non-DM group. The diagnostic power of PET in the hyperglycaemic DM, euglycaemic DM and non-DM groups did not differ significantly with regard to the identification of either metastatic lesions (AUC, 0.967/0.947/0.925, P>0.05) or primary tumours/local recurrence (AUC, 0.950/0.938/0.979, P>0.05). Considering all DM patients, PET showed a significantly higher detection power than MRI/CT scans in respect of metastatic lesions (AUC=0.956 vs 0.824, P=0.012).",no,1,1.0,0,0,0,121,4147

The study found that unmarried status was a borderline risk factor for BV. 4. The study also found that unmarried women had a higher risk for several types of pathological microflora. 5. The study did not find a significant association between unmarried status and poor pregnancy outcome. 6. The study did not find a significant association between microbiological factors and poor pregnancy outcome among unmarried pregnant women. 7. The study did find a significant association between unmarried status and microbiological factors. [ID:PubMedQA-12913347].,not in context,0,0.0,1,1,0,108,2645

The mean postoperative pain score (visual analog scale) was lower for the PRP group at all time points and this was statistically significant (P<.05). Similarly, the scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better among patients in the PRP group. This difference was also not statistically significant.Not in context.
