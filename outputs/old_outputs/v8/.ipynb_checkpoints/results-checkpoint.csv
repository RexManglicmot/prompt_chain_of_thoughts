Six group interviews were conducted with 17 patients with knee osteoarthritis. Discussion topics included first impressions about using color to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with color, how colors related to changes in pain intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using color to describe pain to healthcare professionals. The group interviews indicated that, although the idea of using color was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain; the reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger, and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colors used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness, and happiness. A range of colors was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity.

The RCTs in this paper were conducted to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor.
