105,cot,not in context,"| Reasoning: The article is about vitamin K antagonist (VKA) treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer. The question is about treatment of arterial embolism. The article never mentions arterial embolism or arterial thrombosis. In the conclusion, the authors suggest that for patients with cancer, ""VKA should be used with caution"" (the word ""caution"" implies risk). This sentence is in direct contrast to the answer ""yes"" for the question. Therefore, the answer is ""no"" since the article supports the conclusion that VKA treatment is not indicated for patients with cancer and arterial embolism. |",yes,0,0.0,0,0,1,96,2393

107,cot,not in context,"| Reasoning: The passage describes a 4-year-old boy who presented with a 3-week history of unilateral left-sided chest pain. X-ray, CT scans, and MRI of the chest were normal. The patient was diagnosed with idiopathic costochondritis. The passage does not mention any treatment for this condition. This case report does not mention any other patients or the presence of a trend. There are no numbers to convert to percentages. The patient was a child, which can affect the generalizability of the results. The comparator is not mentioned. There is no effect measure described, which means the risk of recurrence cannot be calculated. There is no risk of bias assessment or other information that would allow a conclusion about the generalizability of the results. There is no information about the follow-up of the patient, which means it is not clear if the reported outcome is a valid estimate of the effect of the treatment. The passage does not mention any similar cases or other relevant information. The conclusion is not justified by the content of the passage. There is no evidence for or against this statement.
