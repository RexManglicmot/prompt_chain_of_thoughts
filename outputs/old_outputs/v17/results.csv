6,cot,yes,"Reasoning: The study is about using colour to describe osteoarthritis pain. The study involved six group interviews with 17 patients with knee osteoarthritis. The interviews were conducted to explore the acceptability and feasibility of using colour to describe osteoarthritis pain, and whether colour could be used to communicate pain to healthcare professionals. The interviews asked about first impressions about using colour to describe pain, whether participants could associate their pain with colour, how colours related to changes to intensity and different pain qualities, and whether they could envisage using colour to describe pain to healthcare professionals. The study found that although the idea of using colour was generally acceptable, it did not suit all participants as a way of describing their pain. The majority of participants chose red to describe high-intensity pain. The reasons given were because red symbolized inflammation, fire, anger and the stop signal in a traffic light system. Colours used to describe the absence of pain were chosen because of their association with positive emotional feelings, such as purity, calmness and happiness. A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours.

The study then states that ""We analyzed the change in volume of uterine myomas between the first half of pregnancy (up until 19 weeks), third quarter (20-30 weeks), and last quarter (31 weeks to term)"" (lines 25-26). Since the study is looking at the change in volume of uterine myomas DURING pregnancy, and the myomas were already present before pregnancy, the study is not examining whether myomas ""grow"" during pregnancy, but rather how the volume of uterine myomas changes during different time points of pregnancy.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease. The authors mentioned that they conducted a retrospective study of 313 children who had a 99mTc-WBC scan. They found that 130 children were studied exclusively to rule out IBD. Then they compared the final diagnosis of these 130 children with the results of their 99mTc-WBC scans. 99mTc-WBC scintigraphy was positive in all but three newly diagnosed Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or miscellaneous colitis children. The false-negative 99mTc-WBC studies were seen in children with mild inflammation on biopsies and normal UGI-SBFT studies. In the 46 children with a true-positive 99mTc-WBC scan, 81% (17/21) of UGI-SBFT studies were normal.

The hearts being studied are hypertrophied pig hearts.

When LAD flow was reduced to 50% of its control level, NNSP resulted in a small but significant decrease in myocardial oxygenation and phosphocreatine, whereas those measurements did not change significantly during NNAP. With LAD flow further reduced to 20% of its control level, both NNAP and NNSP caused a substantial decrease in myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, and phosphocreatine with an increase in inorganic phosphate. However, the changes were significantly greater during NNSP than during NNAP.

Age, sex, education, depression, and cognitive measures (Mini-Mental State Examination and verbal memory) were included in the model. 3) In the model, IADL disability could help predict dementia in addition to the measured variables at 1-year follow-up (odds ratio (OR) = 2.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.51-3.13) and 2-year follow-up (OR = 2.11, 95% CI = 1.33-3.33). 4) Therefore, IADL disability at baseline can help predict dementia at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.",not in context,0,0.0,0,1,0,126,3936

The context also discusses that the study used cross-sectional data collected from 51 commercial ATC teams. The context also discusses that hypotheses were tested using multiple regression analysis.

Hotspots are geographical areas with a high concentration of violent crime incidents. The authors note that data-sharing between the police and emergency medical services (EMS) is limited, despite the potential for police-EMS data-sharing to contribute to the reduction in community violence. 2) The authors used spatiotemporal cluster analysis to identify violent crime incidents, which were then compared to ambulance call for service data. They found that violent crime incidents were highly concentrated in a small number of geographical areas, and that there was a statistically significant correlation between police-recorded crimes and ambulance call for service data. 3) Based on these findings, the authors suggest that data sharing between the police and EMS could be used to identify violent crime hotspots and allocate resources accordingly, potentially reducing community violence. 4) The authors also note that there may be some limitations to this approach, such as the possibility of underreporting of crimes by the police or delays in reporting crimes by the public. 5) Overall, the study suggests that police-EMS data-sharing could be a useful tool for reducing community violence.",not in context,0,0.0,0,1,0,197,4155

The study describes the 8 clinical identifiers, and the 64 patients diagnosed with early-stage adhesive capsulitis by a physical therapist or medical practitioner were included in the study. The study describes that the 64 patients were included and the 8 clinical identifiers in detail. So, we can conclude that the 64 patients were included for the study, and 8 clinical identifiers were also included for the study. The study defines the pain relief of ≥70% for passive external rotation as a positive anesthetic response (PAR). The study identifies that 16 participants (25%) demonstrated a PAR. The study identifies that among the 8 clinical identifiers, global loss of passive range of movement (OR=0.26, P=.03), pain at the end of range of all measured active movements (OR=0.06, P=.02), and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements (OR=0.23, P=.02) are associated with a PAR. The study also identifies that pain at the end of range of all measured active movements remained the only identifier but was associated with reduced odds of a PAR. The study identifies that the 8 clinical identifiers are associated with the PAR. So, we can conclude that the 8 clinical identifiers are related to the PAR.
