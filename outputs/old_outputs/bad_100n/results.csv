Context: A clinical trial reported that aspirin reduced the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction; benefits were consistent across subgroups; no contradictory findings were highlighted in the passage. Q: Does aspirin reduce the risk of recurrent heart attack? Final Answer: yes | Reasoning: the passage states aspirin reduced the risk of recurrent heart attack; effect described as reduction not neutrality; result observed across subgroups implying robustness; no evidence of harm offsetting benefit is given; language is affirmative rather than uncertain; therefore the correct label is yes. Context: A clinical trial reported that vitamin D supplementation improved bone density in older adults; however evidence for fracture reduction was inconclusive according to the passage. Q: Does vitamin D supplementation reduce the risk of recurrent heart attack? Final Answer: no | Reasoning: no reduction was observed; outcomes were the same as placebo; no evidence of harm offsetting benefit is given; therefore the correct label is no | - - Context (ID: PubMedQA-17276182): This study sought to evaluate mutations in genes encoding the slow component of the cardiac delayed rectifier K + current (I (Ks)) in familial atrial fibrillation (AF). One missense KCNQ1 mutation, R14C, was identified in 1 family with a high prevalence of hypertension. Atrial fibrillation was present only in older individuals who had developed atrial dilation and who were genotype positive. Patch-clamp studies of wild-type or R14C KCNQ1 expressed with KCNE1 in CHO cells showed no statistically significant differences between wild-type and mutant channel kinetics at baseline, or after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin. After exposure to hypotonic solution to elicit cell swelling / stretch, mutant channels showed a marked increase in current, a leftward shift in the voltage dependence of activation, altered channel kinetics, and shortening of the modeled atrial action potential duration.

The PHQ-9 scale was completed by 103 participants with low vision. These data were then assessed for fit to the Rasch model. The participants' mean + / - standard deviation (SD) age was 74.7 + / - 2'.1 years. Almost one half of them (n = 46; 4 7%) were considered to have severe vision impairment (presenting visual acuity < 6 / 60 in the better eye). Disordered thresholds were evident initially. Collapsing the two middle categories produced ordered thresholds and fit to the Rasch model (chi = 10.1; degrees of freedom = 9; p = 0.34). The mean (SD) items and persons Fit Residual values were -0.31 (1.12) and -0.25 (0.78), respectively, where optimal fit of data to the Rasch model would have a mean = 0 and SD = 1. Unidimensionality was demonstrated confirming the construct validity of the PHQ-9 and there was no evidence of differential item functioning on a number of factors including visual disability.

Context: - Context (ID: PubMedQA-109663337): We evaluated the usefulness of a short stay ward in a general and academic children's hospital, Westmead Hospital, and an academic Children's hospital, New Children's Hospital, to determine if they are a useful addition to the emergency service. This is a descriptive comparison of prospectively collected data on all children admitted to the short stay ward at Westmead Hospital (WH) during 1994 and the short stay ward at the New Children's Hospital (NCH) during 1997-98. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases. The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 3 0% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward",yes,1,1.0,0,0,0,262,4249
